The School Mate project is a web-based application designed to manage student information efficiently. It allows administrators or teachers to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records. This system helps schools easily track and modify student data such as roll numbers, names, and marks.

Key Features:

Create: Add new student records by entering details like roll number, name, marks, and other relevant information. Read: View a list of all students or search for specific student records based on roll number or name. Update: Modify the existing student records, such as updating marks, name, or roll number. Delete: Remove student records from the database when needed. How It Works:

Add Students: Users can create new student records by entering roll number, name, and marks. View Students: View a detailed list of students, showing their roll numbers, names, and marks. Modify Records: Update student details (such as marks or name) when necessary. Delete Records: If a student is no longer part of the school, their record can be deleted from the system.

Technology Used:

Backend: Python, Django (or Flask) for managing the logic and database. Frontend: HTML, CSS. Database: SQLite to store student information.

Use Cases:

Educational Institutions: For managing student records, marks, and personal details. Admin Panel: School administrators or teachers can access the system to add or edit student data. The School Mate system makes managing student records simple, organized, and user-friendly.
